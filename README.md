## Description
>We all know the importance of forests, we depend on forests for our survival, from air we breathe to the wood we use. Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihood for humans they help to prevent soil erosion and watershed protection. Due to deforestation and many other reasons the endangered wild animals of the forests are becoming extinct. So, we created this 2D game called “FOREST PROTECTOR” to bring awareness about forests and why is it important for us to protect them. The main story begins with the conversation between 2 businessmen. They plan to exploit the rare wild animals in the forest to earn money. So, they try to trap the animals from the forest and exploit the forest resources as well.
	The main game will have enemies moving around trying to trap animals in the forest. The player should try to fight against these enemies and must release the animals from the traps. The game will also have some campers throwing garbage in the forest and damaging the forest unknowingly. The player has to talk to them and explain to them why it is bad to throw garbage in the forest and how it damages the forest. He has to collect the garbage and clean the forest. Based on the player’s performance, he will get coins. Player can also collect treasure chests, to increase his health. The game will end when the timer ends or when the player loses his complete health.
## Technologies used
